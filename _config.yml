# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible

  Right now i've just started reading a book about KVM virtualization but i also like

baseurl: "/blog" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog
url: "https://iamcaye.github.io" # the base hostname & protocol for your site, e.g. http://example.com
